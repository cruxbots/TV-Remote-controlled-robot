# TV-Remote-controlled-robot

In this project we have demonstrated that Arduino based robots can be controlled using simple remote device.

For this project to work, you will be needing a Phototransistor and a mobile robot. If you don't have one refer this [Mr.Big](https://github.com/cruxbots/Mr-Big) to make your own. But you will not be needing all that bulky components, you can simply make it with much simpler and lighter components.
